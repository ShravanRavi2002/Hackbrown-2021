# Food Scrapes
[Our submission](https://devpost.com/software/food-scrapes) for HackBrown 2021.


## About
Sometimes, finding nutrition information when ordering online is really difficult, and this is an issue for those who are health-conscious and/or have dietary restrictions from allergies or otherwise.
Our extension scours for nutrition data on the user's behalf and then displays easy-to-parse information on the food item like the amount of protein, carbs, fat, and sodium.


## Instructions
To use this extension, simply load the [Food Scrapes](Food%20Scrapes/) directory as a chrome extension (turn on developer mode, then load as an unpacked extension).

## Future Improvements
- Expand nutrition scraping to more restaurants, especially in the Austin area
- Include more nutrition information (allergen info, ingredients, etc.)
